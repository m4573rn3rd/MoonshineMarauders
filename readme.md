# Moonshine Marauders Addon

A custom World of Warcraft utility addon designed specifically for the **Moonshine Marauders** guild. This lightweight addon automates combat reporting, tracks your daily earnings, and provides helpful alerts during gameplay.

## Features

*   **Automated Combat Tracker**: Automatically starts tracking damage when a Boss Encounter begins. Upon victory, it reports the top 5 DPS players to the group (Party, Raid, or Instance chat).
*   **Loot & Gold Tracker**: Keeps a running tally of raw gold looted each day.
*   **Quest Counter**: Tracks the number of quests you complete daily and in total.
*   **Target Alerts**: Displays a visual alert in your chat window when you target a **World Boss** or **Elite** enemy.
*   **Market Watch**: If you have the **Auctionator** addon installed, Moonshine Marauders will alert you if you loot an item with a market value over 1 Gold.
*   **Fishing Log**: Automatically logs your map coordinates when you catch fish.
